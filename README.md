# Java Beginner Tasks

Hear me, Dragonborn of the IDE! The Scrolls have foretold your rise—\
one destined to master the arcane arts of Java.\
Battle syntax errors, level up from “Hello World” to heroic object-oriented feats, and shout your code into being.\
If you face monstrous runtime errors, unleash a mighty “Fus Ro Dah!” (but be gentle on your keyboard).

Go forth, hero, and code with honor—may your variables be well-declared and your bugs banished to Oblivion!


### A collection of beginner-friendly Java exercises. These tasks are designed to help new Java developers practice fundamental concepts in an incremental manner. Each task focuses on specific Java features or techniques, helping to progress through the language step by step.

## About the Repository

This repository contains Java tasks and example programs aimed at novice programmers. The tasks range from simple “Hello World!” examples to more advanced topics, such as object-oriented programming, collections, and basic algorithms. Each task is accompanied by instructions and often references additional documentation or tutorials.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher
- A Java IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code)
- Basic knowledge of the command line to run and compile Java files

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A-Dakkak-Badwi/java-beginner-tasks.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project**  
   You can open this project in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode). Alternatively, you can use the command line to compile and run tasks.

3. **Explore the Tasks**  
   Browse the subfolders (or packages in your IDE) to see the different topics and assignments.

## Project Structure

A suggested structure for tasks might be:

```
java-beginner-tasks __ src __
│
├─ tag00
│   ├─ HelloWorld.java
│   └─ README.md (contains instructions for this task)
│
├─ tag01
│   ├─ ASCIICalculator.java
│   ├─ ConvertTemperatur.java
│   ├─ RechteckBerechnung.java
│   └─ README.md
│
├─ tag02
│   ├─ DurchschnittlicheNiederschlagsmenge.java
│   ├─ ModuloBerechnung.java
│   ├─ Zeitberechnung.java
│   └─ README.md
│
├─ tag03
│   ├─ Rabatt.java
│   ├─ ...
│   ├─ ...
│   └─ README.md
│
└─ ...
```

- Each folder focuses on a specific topic (e.g., Hello World, basic syntax, control flow, collections, etc.).
- Each folder might contain:
  - One or more Java source files (*.java)
  - A local `README.md` explaining the concepts, tasks, and any relevant instructions

## How to Use

1. **Pick a Topic**  
   Navigate to one of the folders (e.g., `03_ControlFlow`) to learn about control flow statements.

2. **Read the Instructions**  
   Open the `README.md` file inside that folder for detailed instructions, examples, and tasks.

3. **Experiment & Practice**  
   - Study the provided code examples.
   - Modify the code to see how the changes affect the output.
   - Compile and run the programs:
     ```bash
     javac IfElseDemo.java
     java IfElseDemo
     ```
   - Complete the additional exercises or tasks listed in the folder’s `README.md`.

4. **Check Your Work**  
   - Compare your solutions to sample solutions (if provided).
   - Review your code with online references or Java documentation to reinforce concepts.
