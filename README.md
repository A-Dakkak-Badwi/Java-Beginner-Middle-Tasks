# Java Beginner-Middle Tasks 🐉

Hear me, Dragonborn of the IDE! The Scrolls 📜 have foretold your rise—\
one destined to master the arcane arts of Java.\
Battle syntax errors ⚔️, level up from “Hello World” to heroic object-oriented feats 🏆, and shout your code into being 🗣️.\
If you face monstrous runtime errors, unleash a mighty “Fus Ro Dah!” 🔥 (but be gentle on your keyboard⌨️).

Go forth, hero, and code with honor—may your variables be well-declared 📈 and your bugs banished to Oblivion! 💀


### A collection of beginner-middle-friendly Java exercises. These tasks are designed to help new Java developers practice fundamental concepts in an incremental manner. Each task focuses on specific Java features or techniques, helping to progress through the language step by step.

## About the Repository 📖

This repository is your quest log for mastering Java fundamentals. Journey through a series of tasks—each one a “quest” in your path to becoming the ultimate Java Dragonborn. Encounter simple “Hello World!” spells, dabble in the arcane arts of object-oriented magic, explore labyrinthine loops, and collect knowledge on collections. With each quest you conquer, you’ll be one step closer to legendary Java mastery! ⚔️

## Prerequisites 🗡

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**  
  _Ensure your gear is up-to-date before heading into battle._
- A **Java IDE** or a text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code)  
  _Your modern-day Ebony Sword!_
- A basic understanding of **command-line** usage  
  _So you can successfully shout_ `java MyProgram` _and watch the magic unfold!_

## Getting Started 🚶

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A-Dakkak-Badwi/java-beginner-tasks.git
   ```
   _Your quest begins by calling upon the repository from GitHub’s digital realm._

2. **Open the Project**  
   - Use your favorite IDE (like the College of Winterhold for code)  
   - Or brave the command line (for those with a taste for adventure)

3. **Explore the Tasks (Quests)**  
   - Seek each folder for a new challenge.
   - Summon new powers as you conquer Java fundamentals, quest by quest.

## Project Structure 🏰

A suggested structure for tasks might be:

- **Each folder is a Skyrim-esque quest** focusing on a specific Java concept.  
- **Each folder** might contain:
  - One or more `.java` source files  
  - A **local `README.md`** with quest instructions, lore, and tips  

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Pick a Quest**  
   - Example: `03_ControlFlow` to practice your control flow spells (if-else, switch-case, loops).

2. **Read the Instructions**  
   - Check the `README.md` in each quest’s folder for objectives and suggested arcane knowledge.

3. **Experiment & Practice**  
   - Tinker with the provided code.  
   - Cast the compile incantation:
     ```bash
     javac IfElseDemo.java
     java IfElseDemo
     ```
   - Complete additional tasks to earn more XP and level up. 🔮

4. **Check Your Work**  
   - Compare your solutions with the sample code (if available).  
   - Seek knowledge in the official Java documentation (like your Elder Scroll for coding).
